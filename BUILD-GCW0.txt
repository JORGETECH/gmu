Instructions for building GMU for GCW0/OpenDingux/RG350
-------------------------------------------------------

Note: The "config.mk" Makefile assumes you have installed the toolchain at "/opt/RG350_buildroot/output/host", if this is not the case for you such file MUST be adapted or the build will fail.

-Copy the appropriate mk file

cp gcw0.mk config.mk

-Compile the app:

make distbin

-Give execute permission to the packaging script:

chmod +x package-opk.sh

-Run the packaging script:

./package-opk.sh

-The OPK file will appear at the root of the source code folder with the name "gmu-retrofw.opk"

-(Optional) Clean up after compiling:

make clean
